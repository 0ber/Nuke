# Nuke 4 Migration Guide

Nuke 4 features **Swift 3 compatibility**, and has a lot of improvements both in the API and under the hood. As a major release, it introduces several API-breaking changes.

This guide is provided in order to ease the transition of existing applications using Nuke 3.x to the latest APIs, as well as explain the design and structure of new and changed functionality.

## Requirements

- iOS 9.0, tvOS 9.0, macOS 10.11, watchOS 2.0
- Xcode 8
- Swift 3

> For those of you that would like to use Nuke on iOS 8.0 or macOS 10.9, please use the latest [tagged 3.x release](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/releases) which supports Swift 2.3.

## Overview

Nuke 4 has fully adopted the new **Swift 3** changes and conventions, including the new [API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/).

Nuke 3 was already a slim framework. Nuke 4 takes it a step further by simplifying almost all of its components.

Here's a few design principles adopted in Nuke 4:

- **Protocol-Oriented Programming.** Nuke 3 promised a lot of customization by providing a set of protocols for loading, caching, transforming images, etc. However, those protocols were vaguely defined and hard to implement in practice. Protocols in Nuke 4 are simple and precise, often consisting of a single method.
- **Single Responsibility Principle.** For example, instead of packing preheating and deduplicating of equivalent requests in a single vague `ImageManager` class, those features were implemented as a separate classes (`Preheater`, `Deduplicator`). This makes core classes much easier to reason about.
- **Principle of Least Astonishment**. Nuke 3 had a several excessive protocols, classes and methods which are *all gone* now (`ImageTask`, `ImageResponseInfo`, `ImageManagerConfiguration` just to name a few). Those features were re-implemented in a straightforward manner and are much easier to use now.
- **Simpler Async**. Image loading involves a lot of asynchronous code, managing it was a chore. Nuke 4 adopts two design patterns (**Promise** and **CancellationToken**) that solves most of those problems.

The adoption of those design principles resulted in a simpler, more testable, and more concise code base (which is now under 900 slocs, compared to AlamofireImage's 1426, and Kingfisher's whopping 2357).

I hope that Nuke 4 is going to be a pleasure to use. Thanks for your interest ðŸ˜„

## Changes

Almost every API in Nuke has been modified in some way. It's impossible to document every single changes, so here's a list of some of the major and mostly user-visible changes.

### Basics

#### Drop `Image` Prefix

```swift
ImageRequest -> Request
ImageLoading -> Loading
ImageMemoryCaching -> Caching
ImageDataLoading -> DataLoading
ImageDiskCaching -> DataCaching
ImageDecompressor -> DataDecompressor
... etc
```

#### Loading Images into Targets

Instead of adding extensions to UI components Nuke now has a `Manager` class (similar to [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso)) which loads images into specific targets (see new `Target` protocol which replaced `ImageLoadingView` and `ImageDisplayingView` protocols).

```swift
// Nuke 3
let request = ImageRequest(URLRequest: NSURLRequest(NSURL(URL: "http://...")!))
imageView.nk_setImageWith(request)

// Nuke 4
let request = Request(urlRequest: URLRequest(url: URL(string: "http://...")!))
Nuke.loadImage(with: request, into: imageView)

// Nuke 4 (NEW)
// Use custom handler, target doesn't have to implement `Target` protocol.
Nuke.loadImage(with: request, into: imageView) { response, isFromMemoryCache in
    // Handle response
}
```

#### Request

Memory caching options were simplified to a single struct nested in a `Request`.

```swift
// Nuke 3
public enum ImageRequestMemoryCachePolicy {
    case ReturnCachedImageElseLoad
    case ReloadIgnoringCachedImage
}

public struct ImageRequest {
    public var memoryCacheStorageAllowed = true
    public var memoryCachePolicy = ImageRequestMemoryCachePolicy.ReturnCachedImageElseLoad
}

// Nuke 4
public struct Request {
    public struct MemoryCacheOptions {
        public var readAllowed = true
        public var writeAllowed = true
    }
    public var memoryCacheOptions = MemoryCacheOptions()
}
```

Instead of providing a `shouldDecompressImage`, `contentMode`, `targetSize`  property `Request` now simply sets `Decompressor` as a default processor.

```swift
// Nuke 3
public struct ImageRequest {
    public var processor: ImageProcessing?

    public var targetSize: CGSize = ImageMaximumSize
    public var contentMode: ImageContentMode = .AspectFill
    public var shouldDecompressImage = true
}

// Nuke 4
public struct Request {
    public var processor: AnyProcessor? = AnyProcessor(Decompressor())
}
```

Adding processors to the request is now easier.

```swift
// Nuke 4 (NEW)
request.process(with: GaussianBlur())
```

You can now customize cache (used for memory caching) and load (used for deduplicating equivalent requests) keys using `Request`.

```swift
// Nuke 4 (NEW)
public struct Request {
     public var loadKey: AnyHashable?
     public var cacheKey: AnyHashable?
}
```

#### Transformations

`Processing` protocol is now `Equatable`, `func isEquivalent(other: ImageProcessing) -> Bool` was removed. Nuke now uses [type erasure](http://www.russbishop.net/type-erasure) here and in some other places.

```swift
// Nuke 3
public protocol ImageProcessing {
    func process(image: Image) -> Image?
    func isEquivalent(other: ImageProcessing) -> Bool
}

// Nuke 4
public protocol Processing: Equatable {
    func process(_ image: Image) -> Image?
}
```

#### Preheating

Preheating was moved from `ImageManager` to a separate `Preheater` class. You might create a preheater instance per screen.

```swift
// Nuke 3
let requests = [ImageRequest(URL: imageURL1), ImageRequest(URL: imageURL2)]
Nuke.startPreheatingImages(requests: requests)
Nuke.stopPreheatingImages(requests: requests)

// Nuke 4
let preheater = Preheater()
let requests = [Request(url: url1), Request(url: url2), ...]
preheater.startPreheating(for: requests)
preheater.stopPreheating(for: requests)
```

#### Accessing Memory Cache

You used to have to use `ImageManager` to access memory cache. Now it can be used directly (due to simplified keys management, check out private `Request.Key` if you want to know more).

```swift
// Nuke 3
let manager = ImageManager.shared
let request = ImageRequest(URL: NSURL(string: "")!)
let response = ImageCachedResponse(image: UIImage(), userInfo: nil)
manager.storeResponse(response, forRequest: request)
let cachedResponse = manager.cachedResponseForRequest(request)

// Nuke 4
let cache = Cache.shared
let request = Request(url: URL(string: "")!))
cache[request] = UIImage()
let image = cache[request]
```

### Advanced

#### Loading Images directly

If you do have to load images directly (without using `Manager` and `Target`):

```swift
// Nuke 3
let task = Nuke.taskWith(NSURL(URL: "http://...")!) {
    let image: Image? = $0.image
}
task.resume()
task.cancel()

// Nuke 4
let cts = CancellationTokenSource()
Loader.shared.loadImage(with: URL(string: "http://...")!, token: cts.token)
    .then { image in print("\(image) loaded") }
    .catch { error in print("catched \(error)") }
cts.cancel()
```

#### Redesigned Protocols

Protocols in Nuke 4 are simple and precise, often consisting of a single method.

```swift
// Nuke 4 (NEW)

public protocol Loading {
    func loadImage(with request: Request, token: CancellationToken?) -> Promise<Image>
}

public protocol DataLoading {
    func loadData(with request: URLRequest, token: CancellationToken?) -> Promise<(Data, URLResponse)>
}

public protocol DataCaching {
    func response(for request: URLRequest, token: CancellationToken?) -> Promise<CachedURLResponse>
    func setResponse(_ response: CachedURLResponse, for request: URLRequest)
}

public protocol DataDecoding {
    func decode(data: Data, response: URLResponse) -> Image?
}

public protocol Processing: Equatable {
    func process(_ image: Image) -> Image?
}

public protocol Caching: class {
    subscript(key: AnyHashable) -> Image? { get set }
}
```

### Other Notable Changes

- New custom LRU memory cache instead of `NSCache` (which [is not LRU](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/blob/master/Foundation/NSCache.swift)).
- New `Deduplicator` class (deduplicates equivalent requests) that implements `Loading` protocol. Nuke 3 used to implement this feature in `Loader` class itself.
- Adopt `AnyHashable` instead of `ImageRequestKey` (which was renamed to `Request.Key` and made private).
- Couple of performance optimizations.
